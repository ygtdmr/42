Assignment name  : polyset
Expected files   : searchable_array_bag.cpp, searchable_array_bag.hpp,
searchable_tree_bag.cpp, searchable_tree_bag.hpp, set.cpp, set.hpp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you will find in this directory some classes:
 - bag: an abstract class representing a bag
 - searchable_bag: an abstract class representing a bag with the ability to
 search in it.
 - array_bag: an implementation of a bag with an array as underlying data
 structure.
 - tree_bag: an implementation of a bag with a binary search tree as underlying
 data structure.

If you don't know what is a set or a bag (shame) you can read the attached file:
shame.en.txt

#### First part ####

Since a bag without a searching function isn't very useful, implement two
classes searchable_array_bag and searchable_tree_bag that will inherit from
array_bag and tree_bag (respectively) and implement the searchable_bag abstract
class.

#### Second part ####

Implement the class set that will wrap a searchable_bag and turn it into a set.

You will find in this directory a main that must compile with your code.

All your classes should be under orthodox canonical form.
Don't forget the consts.

The optimization of your code isn't important in this exercise.
